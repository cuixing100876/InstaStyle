# Introduction
**InstaStyle** is a powerful method for stylized image generation. The core idea of InstaStyle is based on the finding that the inversion noise from a stylized reference image inherently carries the style signal. 
It can perform stylized image generation given only one reference image.
Besides, **InstaStyle** can generate images in a combined sytle and supports adjusting the degree of
two styles during combination, demonstrating its flexibility.

# üî•üî•üî• Main Features  
### **Stylized image generation with a single reference image**  
**InstaStyle** excels at capturing style details including colors, textures, and brush strokes.

### **Combination of two styles**  
**InstaStyle**  supports adjusting the degree of two styles during combination, dynamically ranging from one style to another.

# üîß Dependencies and Installation

- Python = 3.11.4
- [PyTorch= 2.0.1, torchvision=0.15.2 ]( https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) 

```bash
# create an environment
conda create -n instastyle python==3.11.4
# activate the environment
conda activate instastyle
# install pytorch using pip
# for example: for Linux with CUDA 11.7
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2
# install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# diffusers
pip install diffusers==0.21.0
# install xformers 
pip install -U xformers==0.0.21
```

# ‚è¨ Download Diffuser Models from Hugging Face (Optional)
The diffuser model can be downloaded automatically when the path is specified as "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", but we recommend that users download the model locally. 

By running download.py, the stable diffusion model will be saved to "./stable-diffusion-v1-4"
```bash
python download.py
```

# üíª Quick run
The experiment can be carried out on a  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU with 24g memory.

We provide a quick start on gradio demo.
```bash
python app.py
```
